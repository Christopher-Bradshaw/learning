# Learning

Notes and examples of various things. The things that live here are either technical (programming languages/libraries) or are well illustrated by code examples (statistical/numerical methods). More mathy things live in handwritten notes.

## Reasons for this

Learning and doing are tightly connected - as a side effect of doing things I learn things!
However, just doing is not the best way to learn - if the only goal is to get stuff done I find that I learn just enough to do what I need to do and convince myself that I haven't made any hideous mistakes.
However, there are probably still huge gaps in what I learned and I likely won't retain it too well.
In some cases this doesn't matter as `thing` might never come up again.
However, in many cases `thing` is going to come up again and again and so spending some time now getting a better understanding of how it works will pay back well in the long term.

This is a place to:
1) Take notes/do toy problems while trying to learn about something. Why - to understand it better now.
2) Store those `notes/explanations that made sense to me/sample code/plots/external resources/examples/etc` in a semi organised way. Why - so that future me can pick it up again quickly.


## If you are not me

1) Hello! Why are you here?
2) Don't trust everything you read here. If I am writing about it here it is probably because I don't understand it that well.
