* Topological Space: I don't really understand this.
See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space)

* Manifold: A topological space (of dimension n) that locally resembles n dimension Euclidean space at all points. E.g. a circle is a 1d manifold because locally it looks like a line. A sphere is a 2d manifold because locally it looks like a plane. A figure of 8 is not a manifold because where the lines cross it doesn't look like a line.

* Fixed point: A point that does not change upon application of a map, system of differential equations. I.e. f(x0) = x0. A fixed point can be classified using a stability matrix into several classes,
See [Wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FixedPoint.html)

    * Hyperbolic fixed point: In a differential equation, this is a point for which the stability matrix has eigenvalues lambda1 < 0 < lambda2. Also called a saddle point.
    See [Wolfram](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicFixedPoint.html)
    * Stable: lambda1 < lambda2 < 0
    * Unstable: 0 < lambda1 < lambda2

* Stability Matrix: The local expansion of a function around a point.
