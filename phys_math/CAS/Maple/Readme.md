# Maple

## Running Maple

All binaries (for my install) are at `~/.opt/maple2020/bin/`

* The GUI application: `xmaple` (or just from the desktop)
* The REPL: `maple`
* A script: `maple script_name.mpl`

## Completions

* If the prefix is unambiguous, a proposed completion will pop up. `tab` inserts.
* To complete e.g. greek letters, or exp, press `esc`. Scroll through the list with the arrow keys and press enter to choose.
* If you insert something with placesholders, e.g. a definite integral that takes 2 limits, a function, and the variable, `tab` through these.
