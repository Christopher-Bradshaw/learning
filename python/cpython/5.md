# Lecture 5

PyObjects - how the useful objects subclass the base PyObject. Mostly focussed on strings (but everything else follows).

## Tuple aside
Kinda interesting, tuple is an array of PyObject pointers. It is immutable. But you can change what those pointers point to if they are mutable.
```
@>>> y = [1,2,3]
@>>> x = (y, 1)
@>>> x
([1, 2, 3], 1)
@>>> x[0].append(4)
@>>> x
([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
```


## String
* I think this is in `unicodeobject` in python3.
* Oh damn, this is a lot more complicated in python3 because variable size chars.
* I'm just going of his lecture, not the code.
* Pystring doesn't have pointer to the chars, it just has them at the end
    * Wait, actually not sure...
    * Note that different pystrings have different sizes
* The code is terrifyingly long but I think most of it is just implementing functions. Append, concat, etc etc. This is conceptually simple (O(n) complexity) as each func doesn't interact with anything.



## Type Checking
* Each type implements a `Py<type>_Check` and `Py<type>_CheckExact`. These macros, defined in the Include/<type>object.h take a pyobject and return true if the type of that object is the type we are checking for. The Check also returns true if the type is a subclass of the type.
