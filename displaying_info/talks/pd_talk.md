Aside about marketing:

Step 1: What is the message

Hard to do because different levels of expertise in the room. Which of these groups do we care about, what do we want them to learn?

Let's think about section 5 in my paper

1) Other grad students/undergrads who don't work in this subfield
We can think of cluster formation as this 2 stage process.

2) Peers in this subfield
Those stages are uncorrelated.

3) Senior professor in this subfield
He came up with a cool but simple decomposition into physically motivated components that can be analysed separately.

4) The rest of the audience (profs etc)


Who do we care about? In order of specialization
Colloquim: 1, 2, 4
Lunch seminar: 2, 4
Speciality conference: 2, 3


Rough structure:

Intro (hi I'm etc)
Build up (what do we care about)
Conclusion of build up (Therefore we need to do X)
X1 (Explain what it is)
X1 conclusions (Explain the result. Grab ack people who fell asleep in the explanation)
X2 ...
No more than X3
Conclusion (wind down and link everything together. Very important but not too many words)

Run through your slides in 2 mins. See if the story follows

Example:
Build up (We want to get halo masses because they can teach us about cosmology)


Single slides:
* Slide title should be the point of the slide (e.g. not "Methods" or "Data Analysis")
* Only 1-2 major points
* Figures in slides don't need to be the same as in papers. They probably shouldn't be the same
    * Break plots with many lines into multiple plots
    * Tiny labels
    * Remove data series that you don't care about


Things to ask before:
* Who is the audience
* What is the venue (big formal talk, casual big talk, casual group meeting)
* How long? When questions
