# D3

## Do you want to use D3?

If you just want a static line plot -- D3 is probably overkill. Use another nice JS library with an API like matplotlib's. Create fig, add data.

> The critical thing to keep in mind is that D3 is not a charting library (though it can be used as such). D3 is a framework for building an expressive range of customized and interactive web-based graphics. D3 provides fundamental building blocks for creating just about any visualization you can imagine.
