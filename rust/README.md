# Rust

Following [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Cargo

The rust build/dependency system. Useful commands,

* cargo new: create a new project (with cargo.toml + src/main.rs)
* cargo build: build
* cargo check: check if it can be built (often a lot faster than actually building)
* cargo run: build and run

## Rust book projects

* hello_world
* hello_cargo
